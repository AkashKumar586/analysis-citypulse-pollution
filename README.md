# **City Pollution Analysis – India (2015–2020)**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes air quality data from Indian cities between **2015–2020** using Python.  
We clean, process, and visualize pollution data (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) to uncover trends and patterns across different cities.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights on air quality for policy makers, researchers, and the general public.

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Delhi** consistently recorded the highest PM2.5 and PM10 levels.  
- Winter months saw a spike in pollution due to crop burning and weather conditions.  
- Coastal cities like **Chennai** & **Mumbai** generally had lower particulate pollution.  
- NO2 and CO levels were highly correlated in industrial regions.  
- Some cities showed improving air quality post-2019, possibly due to policy interventions.

## 📊 Visualizations
The project includes:
- Year-wise PM2.5 trends for major cities  
- Seasonal pollution patterns  
- Correlation heatmaps for pollutants  
- AQI category distribution per city  
- Top 10 most polluted cities by PM2.5 levels
